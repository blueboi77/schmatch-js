It also aims to provide opportunities to acquire hands-on experience and entrepreneurial skills. To reorient graduates of agriculture and allied subjects for ensuring and assuring employability and developing entrepreneurs for emerging knowledge-intensive agriculture, it was felt necessary to introduce this program in all the AUs as an essential prerequisite for the award of degree to ensure hands-on experience and practical training.\n&lt;br&gt;</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Deans committee has given a detailed curriculum of the student READY program for all the disciplines in agriculture and allied sciences.

This is a step forward for “Earn while Learn” concept. Experiential Learning is an important module for high quality professional competence and practical work experience in real life situation to Graduates. The module with entrepreneurial orientation of production and production to consumption pattern is expected to facilitate producing Job Providers rather than Job Seekers. The EL provides the students an excellent opportunity to develop analytical and entrepreneurial skills, and knowledge through meaningful hands on experience, confidence in their ability to design and execute project work.  The main objectives of EL are:\n&lt;br&gt;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To promote professional skills and knowledge through meaningful hands on experience.</li>\n<li>To build confidence and to work in project mode.</li>\n<li>To acquire enterprise management capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rural Agricultural Work Experience (RAWE)</strong> \nThe Rural Agricultural Work Experience (RAWE) provides exposure to agricultural students to the natural setting of the village situations, work with the farm families, identify their problems and make use of various extension tools for transferring the latest agricultural technologies. The students also get opportunity to study the various on-going schemes related to agriculture and rural development and participate in their implementation. The students were given rigorous orientation and familiarization on various issues and problems expected on farmers’ field and hence gain competence and confidence for solving problems related to agriculture and allied sciences. It has been implemented in adopted villages under the supervision of scientists. Activities focused on intensive observations/ analysis of socio-economic and technological profile of the farm families in rural areas, participatory extension approach and acquaintance with farming situations, farm practices and interaction with progressive farmers. Soil testing has become the integral part of RAWE. This helps orient our agricultural graduates for participation in various rural developmental programme. The students also gained first hand information on industries during attachment with identified agro based industries.\nThe stipend rates have been enhanced of Rs 3000/ student/ month for a maximum of 6 months for the village/ rural training under student READY programme.\n&lt;br&gt;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Plant Training (IPT)/ Industrial Attachment</strong> \nTechnology and globalization are ushering an era of unprecedented change. The need and pressure for change and innovation is immense. To enrich the practical knowledge of the students, in-plant training is mandatory.  In this training, students will have to study a problem in industrial perspective and submit the reports to the university. Such in-plant trainings will provide an industrial exposure to the students as well as to develop their career in the high tech industrial requirements.

    "department": "Ministry Of Culture",
    "details": "<p>The Scheme “Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.\n    With a view to infuse fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these Fellows/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\n&gt; <strong>Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1.  Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries\n2.  Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship\n3.  Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology\n4.  Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\n&gt; <strong>Scope of the Scheme:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution.\n&gt; <strong>Duration of the Fellowship:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years.</li>\n<li>In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the fellow won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.</li>\n<li>The award of the Fellowship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Number of Fellowships:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The scheme envisages the granting of up to 15 Fellowships in a year.</li>\n<li>Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Fellowship in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Administration of the Scheme:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants. </p>",

    "title": "Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research",
    "department": "Ministry Of Culture",
    "details": "<p>The Scheme “Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.\n    With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\n&gt; <strong>Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the <a href=\"https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf\">Guidelines</a>, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1.  Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries\n2.  Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship\n3.  Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology\n4.  Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\n&gt; <strong>Scope of the Scheme:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.\n&gt; <strong>Duration of the Scholarship:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.</li>\n<li><p>In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.</p></li>\n<li><p>The award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Number of Scholarships:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.</li>\n<li>Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Administration of the Scheme:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Scholars to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Scholars, through outsourcing or Consultants. </p>",
    "benefits": "<p><strong>Honorarium:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The scholarship honorarium will be ₹50,000/- per month. However, if the scholar is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government set-up in India, he/she would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Essential or mandatory contribution of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.<br />\n&gt; <strong>Contingency Grant:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In case of scholars selected as Tagore Scholars under Non-MoC institutions, will also be paid a contingency grant by the Ministry on an ‘actuals basis’ up to a maximum ceiling of ₹10,000 per month and such other allowances/benefits provided in this scheme, and to the extent, as may be specifically decided in each case by the ILSCC/NSC (within the limits applicable in the case of Tagore National Fellows), depending on the nature and the duration of the project subject to the verification of the bills by the Nodal Institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For scholars selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\n&gt; <strong>Accommodation:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Scholar who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Scholarship.</li>\n<li>The selected Scholar will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Scholars from University, College, Research Institute or Government set up, HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.</li>\n<li>MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.</li>\n<li>In respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Scholars on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Settling Allowance:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Scholar from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of the Scholarship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.</li>\n<li>Allowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Scholarship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and on the conclusion of the Scholarship.</li>\n<li>In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.</li>\n<li>Intimation in advance is also required to be given to the Ministry by the Non-MoC Institutions. MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&gt; <strong>Support to Scholars:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Scholars to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.</li>\n<li>One important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Scholars to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign Scholars engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.</li>\n<li>Encouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Scholars to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged.</li>\n</ul>",
